a todo list that can reorder tasks by drag and drop.
built with: ReactJs, TailwindCss, Firebase, and React-beautiful-dnd 

What I learned:
* setting up and connect firebase to frontend
* adding/requesting/updating/ordering data from firebase
* tailwindcss dark mode
* use react-beautiful-dnd to build a drag and drop list
